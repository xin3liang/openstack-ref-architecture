Install and Deploy the Ceph Cluster
===================================

The current deployment of the DeveloperCloud requires that the Ceph cluster
be in place before the deployment. This describes how to setup Ceph on
servers running Linaro's Debian Reference Platform Build.

Assume the following deploying:

 * ceph monitors: node1, node2, node3
 * ceph osds: node4, node5, node6
 * you can ssh into all nodes as "user.name"

Steps to deploy::
  cd ceph
  # install ceph debian components (not yet in debian):
  ./ceph-install.sh node1 node2 node3 node4 node5 node6
  # deploy ceph monitors
  SSH_USER=user.name ./deph-deploy-mons.sh node1 node2 node3
  # deploy ceph osds
  SSH_USER=user.name ./deph-deploy-osds.sh node4 node5 node6

  # create pools and users needed by OpenStack
  ./ceph-create-openstack-pools.sh node1

  # copy the ceph credentials from our admin node to the other nodes
  ./ceph-copy-creds.sh node1 node2 node3 node4 node5 node6

If you later on add a new OSD, it can be set up by running::
  ./ceph-install.sh node7
  SSH_USER=user.name ./deph-deploy-osds.sh node7
  ./ceph-copy-creds.sh node1 node7
