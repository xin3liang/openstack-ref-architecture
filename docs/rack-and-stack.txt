DevCloud Rack Layout
====================

This document covers how we physically rack and wire components in a
DeveloperCloud rack. There are 4 main components that go into a rack:

 - Top-of-Rack Server (servers as router and public ssh bastion into the
   rack)
 - Switch(es)
 - Serial Console Server(s)
 - DevCloud Servers

Assuming we are in rack1 in the "UK" deployment, we should label components
as uk-r1-router, uk-r1-switch1, and uk-r1-dcX

The top-of-rack components are the TOR server, switches, and serial
console servers. These get deployed in the top of rack from
top-to-bottom:

  top-of-rack server (ie uk-r1-router)
  switch-1 (assuming a 1G)
  switch-2 (assuming a 10G)
  Serial Console Server

The DevCloud servers are then stacked from the bottom up, where
uk-r1-dc1 would be the bottom most server.


Network Cabling
---------------

The network cable for external public network will be connected to
switch1 and configured for VLAN #2.

The router will have 2 nics (say eth0 and eth1). Both nics will be
cabled to switch-1. The switch port for eth1 will be configured in
"trunk" mode and service the private VLAN #10. The switch port for eth0
will be configured for VLAN #2 to give it access to the public network.
It will have a single statically defined IPv4 address. This IP address
will have a DNS entry assigned to it, uk1.linaro.cloud.

The bottom-most server will be used as the network node. It will have 3
nics configure (eth0, eth1, and eth2). eth0 will be its interface to
other systems in lab and will be connected to switch-1 VLAN #10. eth1
will be configured for OpenStack tunnel networking (vm's will use VxLAN
over it). This should be connected to the 10G switch-2 and we'll call this
VLAN #192. eth2 will be connected to switch-1 and its switch port will
be configured for VLAN #2 to provide external network access (and
floating IPs) to OpenStack instances.

The remaining DevCloud servers need two nics (eth0 and eth1) configured.
As with the uk-r1-dc1 network server, eth0 will be connected to switch-1
on VLAN #10 for lab access and eth1 will be on the private tunnel
network VLAN #192 on switch-2.

Power Cabling
-------------

The PDUs should network cables attached to switch-1 on VLAN #10. This
will allow remote PDU control by logging into the main router.
